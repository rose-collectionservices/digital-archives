# LIBSAFE Go
[This page is under construction.]

LIBSAFE Go (LSG) is the preservation repository for most born-digital material—disk images, logical transfers, and processed files. A separate node within LIBSAFE Go is also used to make processed, unrestricted access copies of born-digital material available in the reading room. Legacy born-digital material (primarily disk images with some tar files of processed material) is stored in The Keep, but we have plans to migrate this content to LIBSAFE Go in 2026.

As much as possible, Rose Library's LIBSAFE Go workflows and policies should align with general Collection Services procedures and with the information contained in the TDS-managed [LIBSAFE Go Confluence wiki](https://emorylib.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LG/overview?homepageId=160465038). This page is used to add Rose-specific details that are difficult to outline within the processing workflow document and to clarify how Rose Library is interpreting and applying broader data models and policies within our LIBSAFE Go content nodes.
