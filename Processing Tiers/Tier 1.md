# Tier 1 - Accessioning and Imaging

Tier 1 is imaging or transfer of content and ingest into a preservation repository during the accessioning process. The goal is basic control and stability. All digital content selected for preservation after preliminary appraisal by a curator, processing archivist, or digital archivist will be minimally processed at Tier 1.

Basic Tier 1 steps:
1. Create a digital processing plan and/or media log spreadsheet. A log is often more efficient for accessioning content from large numbers of carriers.
2. Image media or complete logical transfer of files. See the [Imaging](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/digital-archives/tree/master/Imaging%20Instructions) folder for more information on how to image different types of media upon accessioning.
3. Generate Fiwalk reports, with virus checking.
4. Package disk images/logically transferred content and supplemental files (using BagIt, if uploading to The Keep).
5. Ingest packaged content and supplemental files to a preservation repository (The Keep or LIBSAFE Go). See the [Keep upload instructions](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/digital-archives/blob/master/Tier%201/Keep_Ingest.md) for instructions on how to upload bagged materials to the Keep and what metadata to enter.
6. Add basic descriptive metadata to the finding aid. Typically, this includes an archival object for each physical carrier or batch of transferred files. Archival objects can be grouped into a "born-digital materials" series if appropriate. Collection-level metadata should follow the requirements outlined in the [Collection Services Manual](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/05-DESCRIPTION), including at minimum a collection-level processing note about the transfer of data and a collection-level access note ("Researchers must contact the Rose Library in advance for access to unprocessed born digital materials in this collection. Collection restrictions, copyright limitations, or technical complications may hinder the Rose Library's ability to provide access to unprocessed born digital materials.").
7. Add digital object records as instances of the relevant archival object records in ArchivesSpace. The DO records should align with Emory's metadata guidelines for digital archival objects and should link to the storage locations of the packaged files.
8. Add the completed digital processing plan and/or media log to the collection file.
