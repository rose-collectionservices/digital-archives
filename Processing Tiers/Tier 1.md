# Tier 1 - Accessioning and Imaging

Tier 1 is imaging or transfer of content and ingest into a preservation repository during the accessioning process. The goal is basic control and stability. All digital content selected for preservation after preliminary appraisal by a curator, processing archivist, or digital archivist will be minimally processed at Tier 1.

Basic Tier 1 steps:
1. Image media or complete logical transfer of files. See the [Imaging](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/digital-archives/tree/master/Imaging%20Instructions) folder for more information on how to image different types of media upon accessioning.
2. Generate Fiwalk reports, with virus checking.
3. Package disk images/logically transferred content and supplemental files (using BagIt, if uploading to The Keep).
4. Ingest packaged content and supplemental files to a preservation repository (The Keep or LIBSAFE Go). See the [Keep upload instructions](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/digital-archives/blob/master/Tier%201/Keep_Ingest.md) for instructions on how to upload bagged materials to the Keep and what metadata to enter.
