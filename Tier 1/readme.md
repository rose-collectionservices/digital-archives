# Tier 1 - Accessioning and Imaging

See the [Imaging](https://github.com/bedwards254/DAprocessingTiers/tree/master/Tier%201/Imaging) folder for more information on how to image different types of media upon accessioning. 

Standard disk sizes (to help fill out the [processing plan](https://emory.box.com/s/pak4s74af6sjzk62v0isi5jdgzwitvbw) size estimate):

| Media               | Size    |
|---------------------|---------|
| 5.25" floppy disk   | 1.2 MB  |
| 3.5" floppy disk    | 1.4 MB  |
| ZIP 100 disk        | 100 MB  |
| ZIP 250 disk        | 250 MB  |
| Optical disc        | 700 MB  |
