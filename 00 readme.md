# Rose Library Digital Archives Manual

This manual outlines policies and procedures for working with digital collection material at the Stuart A. Rose Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Books Library at Emory University in Atlanta, GA. The manual is maintained by the Rose Library's Digital Archives unit and covers major aspects of the Digital Archives program, including born-digital processing and access, digitization, and web archiving.

The content of this manual will eventually be merged with the Rose Library <a href="https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master">Collection Services Manual</a>. Some digital collections documentation can already be found in the general manual, including guidelines for accessioning and describing digital content.
