# Procedures for Creation and Management of Digitized Collections

## Scope
This guide pertains to project-based digitization of materials selected by Rose Library staff. The procedures do not apply to small-scale digitization requested by patrons; patron requests are handled by the Research Services team as part of the Rose Library's suite of reproduction services. 

This guide covers the aspects of digitization preparation and coordination based in the Rose Library. Specific procedures for digital imaging, post-processing, metadata assignment, and asset ingest are out of scope, as these functions are handled by other departments and covered in non-Rose documentation.

## Roles and Responsibilities
Digitization activities in Emory Libraries are part of the Digital Library Program and employ infrastructure, resources, and staffing shared across the organization. The following individuals and groups play a significant part in advancing digitization initiatives based in the Rose Library:
* Digital Strategy Team (DST) - Rose DST members solicit project suggestions from their teams, put forward recommendations based on donor agreements and known user needs, rank and prioritize projects, and help to prepare project proposals and copyright reviews as requested by the Head of Digital Archives.
* Head of Digital Archives (HDA) - The Rose HDA is the primary liaison between the DST and non-Rose teams working on digitization activities. The HDA guides the DST's project development efforts, ensures proposals and other documentation are completed and submitted per CSC/DWG procedures, and reports back to the DST regularly on digitization and ingest progress.
* Digitization Workflow Group (DWG): The DWG, responsible for moving digital content from scanner to repository, comprises the Head of Digitization Services (HDS), Head of Metadata Services (HMS), Copyright Librarian (CL), and Digital Preservation Program Manager (DPPM). The DPPM acts as coordinator for the group and primary liaison to the DST and CSC. Rose Library’s internal digitization workflows involve DWG members at several points throughout the process.
* Collections Steering Committee (CSC): The CSC includes representatives from across Emory Libraries (including the theology and law libraries); Rose is represented on the committee by the director and associate director. CSC is broadly responsible for decisions affecting library collections and is charged with approving an annual list of digitization projects    as well as reviewing third-party dissemination proposals.
* Audiovisual Conservator (AC): Based in Emory Libraries’ Access and Resources Services division, the AC is responsible for reformatting, digital asset management, and preservation of audiovisual material. Though not involved in content-based selection and prioritization, the AC advises on format- and condition-based prioritization and helps to determine project design and feasibility. 
* Audiovisual Liaison (AL): The AL is a Rose staff member responsible for maintaining Rose-side AV digitization workflows, coordinating with content stewards and the Audiovisual Conservator to plan and carry out AV digitization projects prioritized by the DST, selecting and prioritizing content for preservation digitization (i.e., the creation of digital surrogates intended only for reading room access rather than online public access) and ensuring digitized AV objects are appropriately stored and described for Rose use.
* Content stewards: A content steward is a library employee  with significant knowledge of a collection or investment in its digitization. In the Rose Library, the content steward for a given collection is most often a curator or the University Archivist but may instead be the Head of Collection Processing, Head of Research Services, or another individual familiar with the material. Content stewards are responsible for preparing or contributing to formal project proposals and copyright review forms. Content stewards are also responsible for securing necessary licenses and permissions from rightsholders. 

## Eligible Content
Materials selected for digitization projects using the procedures described herein will be entire collections, significant portions of collections, or substantial aggregations of non-manuscript material. Single-item requests or other small requests received by the Head of Digital Archives or Digital Strategy Team will be redirected to Research Services. Conversely, if Research Services receives a patron request that exceeds that limits of standard reformatting services, Research Services staff may refer the request to the Digital Strategy Team for consideration as a digitization project.

Digitization projects will typically have open online access as the end goal, but digitization may also be recommended for preservation reasons or to provide online access with restrictions   . Digitized book, manuscript, and still image content can be made available in Emory Digital Collections at a range of visibility levels. Digitized audiovisual content can be made available in the Keep (mediated access through Research Services) or Aviary (open     access or mediated access through Digital Archives).

Current infrastructure and workflows allow for digitization of material in most formats. Formats that cannot be handled in house, such as film, or large-scale projects that involve outsourcing or grant funding will require additional planning beyond what is outlined here and may incur direct costs for the Rose Library.

## Workflow and Timeline 
 
### Selection and prioritization
1. At any time throughout the year, Rose staff may recommend collections in any format for digitization and online access by submitting the Digitization Suggestion Form . 
2. In March of each year, the HDA invites Rose staff to submit any suggestions not already on the Digitization/Ingest Priorities list in Airtable. 
   - The HDA should make an early March announcement in a Rose staff meeting or via Slack/email and share a similar reminder late in the month. The HDA should also send reminders throughout the month to DST members specifically.
   - HDA announcements should include a link to the Digitization Suggestion Form in  Airtable. 
   - Suggestions should be submitted by April 1 to receive full consideration for the upcoming fiscal year.
3. Also in March, members of the DST consult with their respective units and identify materials (whether on the list already or not) that are high priorities for digitization based on their core functions. 
4. In April, the DST reviews the status of the previous year's projects, suggestions submitted during the preceding year, and the priorities from each of their areas. The DST scores the suggested projects using the decision criteria.
5. In May, the DST finalizes a list of projects to pursue in the upcoming fiscal year. Based on the decision criteria, material types, amount of preparation required, and DWG capacity, the DST ranks the list and divides it into priority tiers.
   - A typical list consists of 5-10 book, manuscript, or still image projects and 2-3 audiovisual projects.
   - The final number of projects may vary depending on their size and complexity and whether any of the prioritized content has already been digitized.
   - The list should contain at least one project from each major collecting area. 
 
### Book, manuscript, and still image digitization
1. Throughout May and June, the HDA works with select DST members and content stewards to draft project proposals and copyright review forms.
2. As copyright review forms are completed, the HDA forwards them to the CL for feedback and appropriate routing according to the Copyright Analysis Workflow.
3. If a project selected by the DST involves third-party dissemination, the proposer and the HDA prepare and submit a third-party dissemination proposal to CSC no later than June and ensure SMT/Cabinet reviews and approves or denies the proposal no later than July. (See “Third-party dissemination” section below.) In July, the DST will submit proposals and supplemental documentation to the DWG. 
4. In July or August, the HDA (and select content stewards as needed) meets with the DWG to address questions about the proposals, identify potential complications, and establish a plan for beginning work on the projects. 
5. In August, the DWG combines project submissions from across Emory Libraries into a single, prioritized list. The DPPM presents the combined list of digitization and ingest priorities to CSC for approval.
6. If any materials on the approved list are particularly fragile or valuable or the content steward is aware of any preservation concerns, the content steward or HDA schedules a consultation with Conservation to ensure digitization can safely proceed and plan for any stabilization or other treatment that might be required first. (If digitization staff notice condition issues after imaging is underway, they will consult with Conservation directly.)
7. Throughout the year, the HDA delivers new material to the HDS as needed, tracks locations in Aeon, shares with the DST and other Rose staff regular updates from the DPPM/DWG (obtained through regular meetings or from the Digitization Workflow Airtable base), and answers metadata and rights questions raised by the CL and HMS.
8. After ingest, the HDA update finding aids and other records to direct researchers and staff to online access copies or other digital surrogates.
10. The DPPM sends monthly email updates to Emory Libraries listing new additions to the repository. The HDA also shares targeted announcements about online access to digitized collections in the Rose Library #collections Slack channel so that curatorial and Research Services staff can relay the information to donors and researchers as appropriate.
 
### Audiovisual digitization
1. Following prioritization by the DST for online access, digitization of video and audio material follows the workflows managed by the Rose Audiovisual Liaison and the Emory Libraries Audiovisual Conservator.	(Selection for preservation-focused digitization of content that will be made available only in the reading room is outside the scope of the DST and will be handled by the AL and AC. The Scholarly Communications Office and Emory Libraries leadership have approved a blanket policy based on 17 US Code § 108, so no further rights clearance is required for this type of digitization.)
2. The HDA works with the content steward to ensure the deed of gift/sale includes adequate license provisions, to obtain permissions from the relevant rightsholders, and/or to complete a fair use analysis. The HDA prepares a copyright review form to summarize the outcomes of these processes, consulting with the CL as needed. Copyright reviews prepared for audiovisual material are for internal reference and will not be filed with reviews completed under DWG/CSC procedures, as audiovisual digitization has not yet been integrated into centralized Emory Libraries workflows.
3. For material that will be disseminated through a third-party service or platform, the proposer and the HDA prepare and submit a third-party dissemination proposal for review by CSC and SMT/Cabinet. (See “Third-party dissemination” section below.)
4. The HDA downloads or requests access copies and ingest them to Aviary as they become available.   
5. After ingest, the HDA, AL, or processing archivist updates finding aids and other records to direct researchers and staff to online access copies.
6. The HDA shares periodic updates about newly available audiovisual content in the Rose Library #collections Slack channel so that curatorial and Research Services staff can relay the information to donors and researchers as appropriate.

## Decision Criteria
Digitization requests gathered and proposed by DST members will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

### Importance
1. Mission/mandate: Does the project directly support part of the Rose Library's mission or mandate (in a specific way that goes beyond our general mission to provide access to our collections)?
2. Strategic priorities: Does the project directly support one or more of the DST’s core objectives? (weighted 2x)
3. Research value: Does the material have significant research value because of its notability, comprehensiveness, or uniqueness?
4. Innovation: Could the project enable new or creative uses of the collection material or related data?
5. User demand: Do we have evidence of user demand (in the form of reading room use statistics, community stakeholder interest, reference questions, or instructor requests) for online  access? (weighted 2x)
6. Donor commitment: Have we made an explicit promise of digitization to a donor during negotiations or in a deed of gift/sale?
7. Preservation: Would digitization help to preserve or make available material in fragile physical condition?

### Feasibility
8. Processing: Is the collection fully processed/cataloged (or accessioned with no plans for further processing in the future)?
9. Description: Do we have thorough, accurate, and sufficiently granular description on which to base metadata?
10. Rights: Is the rights situation straightforward (e.g., the content is in the public domain or owned by Emory, we can get permission from the donor/creator, there are no privacy concerns)?
11. Size: Is the material a small collection or manageable subset of a larger collection?
 
A "yes" answer to each of the above questions is not required to move forward with a digitization proposal; however, suggestions that receive higher scores are more likely to be developed into proposals and those that score less than 6/13 (scores are out of 13 because there are 11 criteria, of which two are worth double) will generally not be advanced. If digitizing a particular collection would support a Rose Library strategic priority but the prospective project receives a low score, Rose staff should attempt to raise the score by gathering evidence of user demand, enhancing description, identifying rightsholders, etc. before bringing the project forward for consideration again.

## Outsourcing
For some digitization projects, image capture and processing may be outsourced to trusted vendors. This usually happens when 1) Rose Library secures a grant or other external funding to expand access to a particular collection, 2) Rose Library wishes to use its discretionary funds to expedite digitization to meet an external deadline or support a strategic priority, or 3) ARS proposes using its discretionary funds to manage in-house workloads and capacity. 
For AV material, funding options and vendor coordination procedures are typically handled by the AV Conservator and AV Liaison. For other formats, content stewards and the HDS work together to facilitate the process: 
1. HDS and content steward/HDA gather information to inform vendor quotes (e.g., describing type/quantity/condition of materials) and create manifests of collection materials.
2. HDS estimates costs and calculates budget.
3. HDS consults Conservation about whether the materials require a full preservation review; if so, Conservation confirms suitability for outsourcing and prepares a condition report and handling recommendations.
4. HDS obtains bids, negotiates, selects vendor, and arranges PO.
5. HDS and content steward/HDA together determine who will arrange shipping and receiving of materials, based on project timeline, vendor requirements, and material condition and format.
6. HDS tracks project in Airtable and receives and QCs digital assets.
7. Content steward receives physical materials shipped back by vendor.
Note that unusual circumstances might warrant a modified process with more input from Conservation, Rose Research Services, etc. (e.g., fragile or valuable materials with different packing and insurance needs, digitization arranged by another organization as a loan).

## Third-Party Dissemination  
The dissemination of Rose Library digital collections to non–Emory University access services, such as vendor databases and open-access portals, is governed by the Emory Libraries Third-Party Dissemination Policy. To propose that Rose Library digitize content for or otherwise contribute material to such services and projects, Rose staff should consult the DST. If the DST votes to support the initiative, Rose staff will prepare a proposal using the third-party dissemination proposal template and route it for review by CSC and SMT/Cabinet according to the official review process.    

Like any other non-AV material destined for online access, non-AV content being digitized for third-party dissemination and/or ingested to Emory Digital Collections in addition to a third-party platform must be placed on the annual priority list and reviewed by DWG and CSC. To allow time for the submission of digitization proposals to the DWG, dissemination proposals should be routed to CSC no later than June prior to the beginning of the fiscal year in which the project will be done. If a third-party dissemination proposal has not been approved by the time a project list and proposals are due to DWG in July but approval is likely, the DST or HDA may authorize moving forward with a conditional proposal to ensure time is allotted for the project. In this circumstance, initiation of digitization work is contingent on completion of the third-party dissemination approval process.

Note that this policy and workflow do not apply to use of Rose Library material by researchers who obtain copies and permission under Research Service procedures. The third-party dissemination workflow is designed to guide handling of large-scale requests, multi-institution collaborations, formal partnerships, and other arrangements outside of standard patron services.

## Managing Digitized Rose Content
The Head of Digital Archives has Manager-level permissions in Curate, the application used to manage Emory Digital Collections content. Other Rose staff may have Viewer or Depositor access. 
To request changes to collection-level metadata, contact the Head of Digital Archives. If a member of the Rose Digital Archives team is unable to make the changes, or if the changes are extensive, they will consult the Digital Preservation Program Manager or Repository Program Manager.
To request changes to item-level metadata, content stewards should fill out the Metadata Change Request Form. Form submission will trigger an email to the Head of Metadata Services and the Digital Preservation Program Manager, who will update the metadata in Curate and any other required systems. Rose staff who notice metadata issues (or receive metadata-related feedback from researchers) but are not content stewards should share their observations with the appropriate content steward, who will decide whether to request a change. Rose staff, including those classified as Managers in Curate, are not permitted to edit item-level metadata directly in Curate at this time; this could change with future repository development.
If you notice any other problems with Emory Digital Collections items or metadata, notify the Head of Digital Archives.
