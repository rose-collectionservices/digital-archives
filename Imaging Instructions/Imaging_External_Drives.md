## External Hard Drives

### Equipment 
#### Materials Needed:
- Collection hard drive
- Collection hard drive USB cord
- Collection hard drive power cord (optional)
- Tableau USB 3.0 Bridge

#### Software Needed:
- BitCurator environment
- GuyMager

### Instructions:
1. Make sure the computer is in the BitCurator environment (See [here](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/digital-archives/blob/master/Tier%201/Switching_BitCurator_Windows.md) for how to switch. Right click to open in a new tab.)
2. Connect the USB of the hard drive to the USB port of the Tableau bridge. 
3. Connect the Tableau Bridge to the computer using the <span class="blue">BLUE</span> USB cable 
4. Plug in the bridge to its power source. 
5. Push the power button on the Tableau bridge to turn it on. All of the lights should be on. 
6. Launch Guymager (Desktop\Imaging and Recovery\Guymager).
7. In the Guymager window, select the correct drive and right click to bring up the imaging menu. Select “Acquire image.”
8. Select “Expert Witness Format, sub-format Guymager (file extension .EXX)” as file format and enter basic metadata, as relevant. 
Refer to Metadata Guidelines for guidance:
- Under “Split,” type in an amount above what the total of the drive says it is. Ex. 5 GB on a 4GB drive, to make sure it doesn’t split.
- *Case Number:* Record ID (MSS# then _ then a successive 2 or 3 digit number)
- *Evidence Number:* Disk Number/Title
- *Examiner:* Imager’s Net ID (e.g., dwaugh, elfarr)
- *Description:* Brief description of media (e.g., collection name and type of drive it is, and number if applicable (Rita Ann Higgins flash drive 1)) and physical label, if applicable.
- *Notes:* As needed

9. Browse to directory in which newly created image will be stored.

11. The information file name will automatically populate with whatever file name is entered for the image. This will be the file name for the metadata generated by Guymager.
12. Select all check boxesat the bottom(“Calculate MD5,”“Calculate SHA-1,”“Calculate SHA-256,”“Re-read source after acquisition for verifications (takes twice as long),”and “Verify image after acquisition (takestwice as long)”)
13. Hit “Start”

**NOTE:** You can check the progress of disk imaging by scrolling to the right in the Guymager window.
